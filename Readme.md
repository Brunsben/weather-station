# Weatherstation

## Introduction

In here you'll find the code to build your own small weatherstation.  
The idea was to create a simple and fast environment to send, store and display weather related data on a dashboard.  
For this I've hooked a BME280 sensor to some Wemos D1 (ESP8266 compatibles) boards.  
The boards are sending their data via wifi every x minutes to the dashboard's api.


## Blabla

Feel free to change, share and improve the code. 

## Hint

If you are german, or understanding at least some parts of the language:

Here is a video, showing how I build the stuff:
