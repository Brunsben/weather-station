# Weatherstation Dashboard Devices

## Introduction

These are the sketches you can use to send data to the dashboard.
The code is written to run on Wemos D1 devices (ESP8266 compatible).

If you want to send your data via http(s)-request use the code in "client_http" otherwise there is also a mqtt-client.

#### Let's Encrypt  
  
If you want to use SSL-Encryption via Let's Encrypt, you should use the code in _"client-https-root-ca"_.  
This sketch verifies against the root CA, instead of your personal one. Otherwise you have to update and reupload your sketch
every 3 month. This sketch is not tested very well. So if you find any bugs: Please fix and merge them. :)

Open the project and edit the settings.h file to the belongings you need. There are some differences between these two versions, but I'm sure you will know what you have to edit, when you took at look.
